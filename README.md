👋 Hey, I'm PR1NT3R! 

🌐 Check out my hobby project – a personal website I'm crafting from scratch. It's a hands-on learning experience as I build it ground up. Please note, it's still a work in progress, so expect some rough edges.

🎉 Fun fact: I'm fluent in three languages – Polish, English, and JavaScript! Yes, you read that right. 😉

🎮 Let's connect on Discord too! You can find me as "ogniwo". Feel free to drop by and say hi!

📚 Learning is a continuous adventure, and I'm embracing every step of it. Connect with me to share insights and ideas or simply to chat about tech and coding.

Keep coding and stay curious! 🌱
